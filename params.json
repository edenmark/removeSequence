","body":"### Welcome to removeSequence.py\r\n\r\n### 454 Pyrosequencing\r\n\r\nIn this DNA sequence method, DNA nucleotides are sequenced by a 'sequencing by synthesis' approach, in which nucleotides in a sequence are detected by the release of a pyrophosphate. There are pros and cons to this method, which will not be discussed here. However, the result of this approach is hundreds or thousands of different reads, each roughly 200-400 bp long. In order to allow for identification of the sequences, barcodes and primers are added to the sequences. Sometimes, smaller 'fusion adaptor' sequences are added to the beginning of the sequence.\r\n\r\n### removeSequence.py\r\n\r\nThis program is especially useful for remove fusion adaptors or other pre-barcode and pre-primer sequences before use of a processing pipeline that does not allow for distal barcodes and primers (a pipeline in which the barcodes and primers must be at the very beginning of the sequences). Some pipelines does not have the capability to check for distal barcodes/primers, so therefore many sequences will be thrown out because the pipeline doesn't recognize that there are sequences before the barcodes/primers. This program removes that beginning sequence.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\n\r\nThis program was created by Evan Denmark (@edenmark) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
