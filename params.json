","body":"### Welcome to removeSequence.py\r\n\r\n### 454 Pyrosequencing\r\n\r\nIn this DNA sequence method, DNA nucleotides are sequenced by a 'sequencing by synthesis' approach, in which nucleotides in a sequence are detected by the release of a pyrophosphate. There are pros and cons to this method, which will not be discussed here. However, the result of this approach is hundreds or thousands of different reads, each roughly 200-400 bp long. In order to allow for identification of the sequences, barcodes and primers are added to the sequences. Sometimes, smaller 'fusion adaptor' sequences are added to the beginning of the sequence, which is really annoying because many sequence processing pipelines do not have a the ability to detect these fusion adaptors\r\n\r\n### removeSequence.py\r\n\r\nThis program removes these uneccesary fusion adaptors or any other beginning sequence, given that you provide the FASTA file with the sequences and the sequence itself as a string.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\n\r\nThis program was created by Evan Denmark (@edenmark) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
